# materialfusion
The project is an implementation of image stitching&fusion method for microstructure images.

In this project, I use SiftGPU ( https://github.com/pitzer/siftgpu ) to accomplish speed-up feature extraction. I complied SiftGPU with CUDA on, if your device doesn't support such function or if you want to use it under GLSL-mode, you can compile it by yourself.
